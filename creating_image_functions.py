    """
    Convert a FITS data file into a photon counts array. Begins by defining the softening parameters
    for each of the grz bands (necessary?) befroe creating an empty (3, x, x) array. Each band in 
    the image (grz) is run through the flux_to_counts function, outputting the number of photon counts
    for each pixel of the image in each band. This is appended to the empty array and pased through 
    the poisson_noise function to return a rescaled version of the image. Finally a reverse of the first 
    process is conducted to convert the scaled photon counts back into the original flux format of the
    FITs file so it can be processed into a .png later.
